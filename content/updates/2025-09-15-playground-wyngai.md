# The Playground Strategy - Building Value While Building Product

**September 2025**

Continuing to build the iOS application while searching for ways to provide clear value to potential users before the ultimate product was ready. Sometimes the best strategy is to build in public and learn along the way.

**Two Domains, Two Purposes**

I had the main company website at www.mywyng.co—our professional face to the world. But I also purchased www.getwyng.co with a different intention. This would be my playground.

Where the main site needed to be polished and perfect, GetWyng could be experimental. Where corporate messaging needed to be careful, this space could be authentic and iterative.

**The Gift and Curse of Ideas**

One of my unfortunate gifts is that I typically have a LOT of ideas—some good, some not so good. Last year, I made a conscious decision: pursue ideas if they don't prove detrimental to the foundation. I'm fine with trying something and failing. I'm not fine with not trying at all and regretting it.

**Combating Misinformation with WyngAI**

Most of what I was seeing in the healthcare information market involved a great deal of misinformation. People were getting advice from forums, social media, and AI tools that weren't trained on actual regulatory data. This was dangerous.

I started by creating a focused tool on GetWyng where anyone could ask questions related to health insurance, and our WyngAI chat would provide specific responses with regulatory citations. Not generic advice. Not "consult your plan documents." Real answers with real sources.

**Building Trust Through Transparency**

This experiment served multiple purposes:
- **Validation**: Testing our AI's ability to parse complex regulatory data
- **Visibility**: Showing potential users and investors what we're capable of
- **Value**: Providing immediate help to people with real problems
- **Learning**: Understanding what questions people actually have

The iOS app development continued in parallel, but this web-based tool let us start helping people immediately. Why wait for the perfect product when you can provide value today?
