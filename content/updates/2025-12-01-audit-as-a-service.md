# Audit-as-a-Service - The ICHRA Pivot

**December 2025**

After conversations with the portfolio founder, I realized we might need to pivot our approach. Not our mission—our method. Sometimes the best products evolve from understanding how the market is changing, not just how it exists today.

**The ICHRA Revolution**

Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs) are fundamentally changing how employers offer health benefits. Instead of managing health plans, employers give employees money to buy their own insurance. It's a seismic shift that's accelerating.

More companies are shifting to ICHRAs because they're tired of being in the healthcare business. They want to offer benefits without the complexity, compliance headaches, and constant employee complaints about coverage.

**The Opportunity in the Shift**

Several companies have already streamlined the end-to-end ICHRA compliance process. They're handling the administration, the reimbursements, the regulatory requirements. But there's a gap—a massive one.

When employees become responsible for their own insurance, they also become responsible for understanding their bills, catching errors, and fighting overcharges. The billing error problem doesn't go away; it just shifts from HR departments to individual employees who are even less equipped to handle it.

**Our Strongest Asset**

Our custom algorithm to accurately identify potential billing errors is our strongest selling point. We've built technology that can analyze bills against actual negotiated rates and spot discrepancies that humans miss.

What if we didn't have to reach every employer or every employee directly? What if we could embed our protection into the platforms they're already using?

**Audit-as-a-Service**

The pivot became clear: rework our technology to serve as the protective audit layer for ICHRA platforms. Create APIs that allow other companies to offer billing error protection to their users.

Instead of competing for direct customers, we become the infrastructure that powers billing accuracy across multiple platforms. Every ICHRA platform could offer "Powered by Wyng" protection.

**Why This Makes Sense**

- **Distribution**: Reach thousands of employees through a single integration
- **Scalability**: APIs scale infinitely better than direct sales
- **Focus**: We do what we do best (finding errors) while partners handle customer relationships
- **Revenue**: Predictable B2B contracts instead of unpredictable B2C acquisition

**The Technical Pivot**

This means rearchitecting our system:
- Building robust APIs for bill submission and analysis
- Creating white-label reporting interfaces
- Developing real-time processing capabilities
- Ensuring HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level

**Is This Really a Pivot?**

I know, I know—this is a pivot. But it's not abandoning our mission; it's finding a better way to accomplish it. We're still protecting people from billing errors. We're still saving them money. We're still fighting the information imbalance in healthcare.

We're just doing it at scale, through partners, as the protective layer that the entire ICHRA ecosystem desperately needs.

*Sometimes the best pivots aren't about changing what you do, but changing how you deliver it. The problem remains the same; the solution just got more scalable.*
