# Going Mobile-First - iOS Development Begins

**August 2025**

One key insight from our investor conversations was clear: for bill auditing to be truly accessible, it needed to be mobile-first. People receive bills on their phones, take photos with their phones, and want immediate answers on their phones.

**The iOS Decision**

We made the strategic decision to start iOS app development. While our web-based demo showed the concept worked, a native app would provide the seamless user experience needed for mass adoption.

**SwiftUI Implementation**

We chose SwiftUI for its modern approach to iOS development. The framework allows for rapid iteration while maintaining the native performance and user experience that iPhone users expect.

Key features we began building:
- Seamless bill scanning using device camera
- OCR integration for document text extraction
- Insurance information secure storage
- Real-time audit results display
- Shareable reports and action items

**Mobile-First User Experience**

Designing for mobile forced us to simplify and prioritize. Every screen had to serve a clear purpose. Every interaction had to feel natural. This constraint actually improved our product—the mobile experience became cleaner and more focused than our web version.

**The Technical Foundation**

Behind the mobile interface, we were building the same robust audit engine that powered our web demo. The difference was packaging it in a way that felt native to how people actually interact with their healthcare bills.

This shift to mobile development represented more than a platform choice—it was a commitment to meeting users where they are, when they need us most.
