# When Vision Doesn't Align

**October 2024**

More of the MVP was developed. We found a company to provide the necessary API connections to make our application function fully. The technical pieces were coming together.

**The Critical Disconnect**

My co-founder and I had only had one official meeting at this point—a red flag I should have paid more attention to. The relationship was being pressure tested, and something fundamental became clear: we had very different ideas about what the final product would look like and what we would actually be building.

This wasn't a small disagreement about features or priorities. This was a vital disconnect about the core vision.

**Communication is Everything**

Communication and clarity on direction is so important—more important than I realized. When co-founders have two different ideas and directions, it's impossible for the company to arrive at the same destination. You can have the best technical foundation in the world, but if the humans aren't aligned on where you're going, none of it matters.

**The MVP Progress**

Despite the growing tensions, we kept building. The MVP was taking real shape, and the vision I had for helping smaller health plans was getting closer to reality. But I was starting to realize that execution requires more than just shared excitement—it requires shared understanding of what you're actually executing.
