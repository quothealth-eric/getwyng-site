# The Beginning - Finding the Right Foundation

**April 2024**

The journey started with one crucial realization: incorporating a startup is fundamentally different from the S-Corps and LLCs I'd created before. This wasn't just about forming a company—it was about building something that could scale, accept investment, and potentially grow into something much bigger.

I found an attorney in New Jersey who specialized in Delaware incorporations for startups. Having someone who understood the nuances of equity splits, ESOP planning, and investor-ready structures was essential. At this point, I was a solo founder, but I knew the scope of what I wanted to build would require a technical co-founder.

**The Network Reality Check**

My network was small. I only knew a handful of people with technical backgrounds from previous companies, and their skills were very specific and nuanced. This led me to YC's co-founder match and to start my YC application.

Looking back, our application wasn't incredibly strong—classic case of being too early in the process. But this forced me to really articulate the vision and understand what I was building.

**The Vision: Quot Health**

The company was called Quot Health, Inc., focused on price transparency around the new Transparency in Coverage (TiC) regulations. Hospitals had been required to publish their rates in Machine Readable Files, and health insurance companies now had to make their negotiated rates public and provide "shopping" tools for their members.

The opportunity felt massive, but I was still figuring out exactly where we fit.
