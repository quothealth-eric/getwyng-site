# The Consumer Pivot - From Compliance to Empowerment

**March 2025**

The shifting political landscape made our decision clear. Instead of building FOR insurance companies, we would build for the people dealing with them. Our focus completely shifted to the consumer.

**The Problem That Isn't Going Away**

Healthcare costs were rising—as they do every year. More than 80% of hospital bills have errors. With the data we had access to, we could offer a vital service by recovering lost dollars due to billing errors.

If we had users' insurance information and utilization, along with available negotiated rates, we could determine exactly how much a bill SHOULD have cost at the time of submission.

**The Competitive Landscape**

I knew there were big players in the bill audit space already. So how would we be different? I vowed not to just be another service, but to create a truly technology-based tool that would follow users wherever and whenever they needed it.

**UI/UX Transformation**

We made significant adjustments to our UI/UX to reflect this consumer focus. The same underlying technology that could help insurance companies comply with transparency requirements could help individuals understand and challenge their bills.

**The Technology Advantage**

The big players were primarily services—they audited bills on behalf of users. While valuable, this didn't address the fundamental problem. We needed to go further upstream. We were positioned to leverage AI to not only speed up bill auditing but make it scalable and accessible to any American who wanted to use it.

This pivot felt right. The regulatory landscape might be uncertain, but people getting overcharged for healthcare wasn't going anywhere.
