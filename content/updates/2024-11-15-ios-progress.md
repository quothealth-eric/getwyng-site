# iOS App Progress + Investor Conversations
> November 15, 2024

## 🎉 What Happened

Two parallel tracks this week: shipping code and shipping the story.

On the product side, the iOS app hit 85% completion. Core flows are working: onboarding, insurance verification, bill upload, and audit results. The UI feels clean. The experience feels... right.

On the fundraising side, had four investor conversations. The reception is warm but consistent: "We love it. Show us traction."

## 💰 Investor Feedback (Anonymized)

> "The problem is real, the market is big, but you're pre-launch. Come back with pilot data."

> "Love the technical depth. Worried about solo founder risk. Who's your #2?"

> "This feels like a Series A story. Hard to price at pre-seed without users."

> "Why you? What's the unfair advantage?"

**My takeaway:** The story resonates. The credentials check out. But pre-launch + solo founder + no revenue = hard to fund at target valuation.

This is why we pivoted to F&F first.

## 💡 What I Learned

**Investors pattern-match.** They've seen healthcare startups fail. They've seen solo founders burn out. They've seen "AI" buzzwords that don't deliver. My job is to break their pattern recognition by showing I'm different.

How? Not by arguing—by shipping.

## 🤔 Honest Reflection

There's a tension between "move fast" and "get it right." In healthcare, getting it wrong is expensive—not just in dollars, but in trust.

I'm taking the extra time to make sure the audit engine is bulletproof. Every citation needs to be accurate. Every recommendation needs to be defensible. If we tell someone their bill is wrong, it better actually be wrong.

That's slower than I'd like. But it's the right call.
