# New Year, New Guidance, New Uncertainties

**January 2025**

In my day-to-day work, I met one of what would become my most valuable advisors. He held executive positions at some of the top health insurance companies in the country. His guidance would prove crucial in the months ahead.

**Finalizing the Separation**

My co-founder and I finally completed our separation. The paperwork was signed and official. I was a solo founder again—this time by choice and with hard-earned lessons about what makes partnerships work.

**Shifting Political Landscape**

The macro environment was shifting underneath us. We were now under a new administration focused on pushing their agenda quickly. My solution was non-partisan—price transparency shouldn't be politicized—but I couldn't be certain what would happen.

Health insurance companies have significant lobbying power. Would they still be required to make their prices transparent to members? The regulatory foundation of our entire business model was potentially at risk.

**The First Real Pivot Decision**

This uncertainty forced me to consider our first major pivot. If the regulatory requirements changed, our B2B model focused on helping health plans comply might disappear overnight.

But there was another way to look at it: instead of building tools FOR insurance companies, what if we built tools for the people dealing with them?

The writing was on the wall. It was time to shift focus from the insurance companies to the consumers who needed transparency the most.
