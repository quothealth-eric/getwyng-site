# Third LOI Signed + Pilot Prep Mode
> December 11, 2024

---

## 🎉 What Happened

Big week. We signed our third Letter of Intent—this one with an enterprise client (6,000+ employees). That brings our total pipeline to 30,000+ lives for Q1 2026 pilots.

Three LOIs might not sound like much, but in B2B benefits sales, these represent real commitment. These aren't tire-kickers—they're HR leaders who've agreed to bring Wyng into their benefits stack.

## 💡 What I Learned

**Enterprise sales cycles are long, but not impossible.** The key unlocks:

1. **Warm intros matter.** Two of three LOIs came through advisor connections (thanks Chad).

2. **Timing is everything.** Open enrollment season means HR teams are thinking about 2026 benefits NOW.

3. **ROI framing wins.** When I shifted from "consumer empowerment" to "$3-6 PMPM savings," conversations changed.

## 🚧 What's Blocking Me

1. **Production infrastructure timeline.** Need GCP migration done before pilots can go live. Currently bottleneck.

2. **App Store review unknowns.** First submission coming soon. No idea how long Apple will take.

3. **Bandwidth.** Solo founder doing product, sales, fundraising, and ops. Something always slips.

## 🤔 Honest Reflection

The LOIs feel good, but they're not revenue. The real test is Q1 2026: Will employees actually use it? Will we find real billing errors? Will the savings materialize?

I'm confident in the product. I'm confident in the problem. But I've been in healthcare long enough to know that execution is everything.

Head down. Keep building.
