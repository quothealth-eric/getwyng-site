# Predicting and Pinpointing - Finding Our True Differentiator

**May 2025**

We began adjusting the application direction while focusing on what would be our true differentiator. The more I worked in this space, the clearer the fundamental problem became.

**The Information Imbalance**

There's a tremendous information imbalance in healthcare that results in a power differential. People are often taken advantage of simply because they don't know what they don't know. The information is available, but people don't know what to do with it.

**Transparency Without Accountability is Worthless**

Nationally, we're seeing a major push for transparency—which works in our favor. However, transparency without accountability is worthless. The larger players in the space still aren't empowering consumers to make the best decisions for themselves, partially because they don't have ready access to information when they need to make those decisions.

**Our Two Core Functions**

By this point, Wyng was focused on two key functions:

1. **Predicting**: We had the tools to accurately predict costs of care
2. **Pinpointing**: We could pinpoint billing errors against what should have been billed

**The Timing Problem**

The information exists, but timing is everything. When you're sitting in a hospital bed or facing a medical emergency, you don't have time to research prices or understand your benefits. We needed to make this information accessible at the moment of need.

**Continuing to Refine**

We needed to continue refining our application to increase both the accessibility and accuracy of our billing audit tool. The technical foundation was solid, but the user experience needed to be seamless.
