# The Solo Grind - When Schedules Don't Align

**August 2024**

I started building our internal repository of resources, product requirements, and company philosophy. Working with a co-founder while both of us were fully employed meant finding "off-hours" to work together. I'm an early bird but have no problem working late when needed—I was committed to doing whatever it took.

**The Compatibility Test**

Remember last month when I talked about compatibility? This is where it got tested. We couldn't come to an agreement on when and how we would meet to push Quot Health forward. Different work styles, different availability, different levels of urgency.

But I kept working.

**Building the Foundation**

While navigating the co-founder situation, I made real progress:
- Downloaded the necessary TiC files
- Researched companies for insurance verification/eligibility APIs
- Began building out the architecture for our application

The technical foundation was taking shape, even if the human foundation was shaky. Sometimes the work has to continue despite the uncertainty around you.

**The Learning**

You can't force alignment where it doesn't exist naturally. Energy spent trying to make incompatible schedules work is energy not spent building the product.
