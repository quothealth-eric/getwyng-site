# Pivoting Fundraise Strategy
> October 22, 2024

---

## 🎉 What Happened

Made a big decision this week: we're pivoting from a $1.5M pre-seed target to a smaller $250K-$1M Friends & Family round.

This wasn't plan A. But after 15+ investor conversations, the pattern was clear: pre-launch healthcare startups with solo founders don't get venture pricing. At least not the pricing I want.

## 🧠 The Logic

### Option A: Raise Pre-Seed Now
- Likely valuation: $4-6M
- Amount: $750K-$1.5M
- Dilution: 15-25%
- Timeline: 3-6 months of full-time fundraising

### Option B: Raise F&F, Launch, Then Pre-Seed
- F&F valuation: Less formal (SAFE, no cap or high cap)
- Amount: $250K-$1M
- Dilution: 5-10%
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks
- Then raise pre-seed with **traction** at 2x+ better terms

I chose Option B.

## 💡 Why This Is The Right Call

1. **Preserve equity early.** Every % matters when you're solo.

2. **Traction changes everything.** "3 signed LOIs" is good. "10,000 users with $X savings" is venture-fundable.

3. **Speed to market.** I should be building, not pitching. F&F is faster.

4. **Raise from strength.** When I go back to VCs, I want to negotiate, not beg.

## 🚧 The Risks

- F&F rounds are awkward. Asking friends and family for money hits different.
- Smaller runway means less margin for error.
- If pilots underperform, the next round gets harder.

I'm okay with these risks. The upside is worth it.

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize SAFE terms (MFN, no cap for now)
- [ ] Create F&F pitch summary (simpler than VC deck)
- [ ] List of 20 potential F&F investors
- [ ] Personal outreach begins next week

## 🤔 Honest Reflection

Pivoting fundraise strategy feels like admitting defeat. It's not.

The market gave me feedback. I listened. The goal hasn't changed—build the healthcare guardian angel, help millions of families. The path just got more pragmatic.

I'd rather own more of a successful company than less of a struggling one.

## 📝 For Other Founders

If you're hitting walls with VCs, ask yourself:

1. Is it the market? (Bad timing, too niche)
2. Is it the founder? (Credibility gap, team concerns)
3. Is it the stage? (Too early for what you're asking)

For me, it was #3. The ask was too big for where we are. Adjusting the ask isn't failure—it's strategy.
