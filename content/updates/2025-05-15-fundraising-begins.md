# The Fundraising Journey Begins

**May 2025**

With the product vision clear and the market opportunity validated, it was time to start our fundraising journey. We set an ambitious target: $1.5 million for our pre-seed round.

**The VC Approach**

Initially, we focused on VCs and institutional investors. The healthcare technology space was hot, price transparency was a regulatory tailwind, and our AI-driven approach to bill auditing felt differentiated enough to warrant serious investor attention.

We began having conversations with multiple investors across different stages and focus areas. Some specialized in healthcare technology, others in consumer fintech, and several in early-stage B2B software.

**The Learning Process**

Every investor conversation was a masterclass in refining our pitch, understanding our market, and clarifying our value proposition. The questions were sharp:
- "How do you differentiate from existing bill audit services?"
- "What's your customer acquisition cost for B2B vs. DTC?"
- "How do you handle the regulatory complexity?"
- "What happens if transparency requirements change?"

**Building Toward Traction**

While investor interest was genuine, a clear pattern emerged: everyone loved the story, the market opportunity, and the team, but they wanted to see traction first. This wasn't a rejection—it was valuable feedback about timing and approach.

The feedback was consistent enough that we knew we needed to pivot our strategy. But first, we needed to build the product that would generate that traction.
