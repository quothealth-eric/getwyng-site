# Wyng is Born - From Quot Health to Guardian Angel

**April 2025**

Two major changes shaped this month: I found a new attorney who understood startups, and our company went through a complete rebrand.

**New Legal Partnership**

I found an attorney who specialized in working with startups specifically. The lead attorney was a multiple-time founder with exits under his belt—he understood the struggles of startup founders from personal experience, not just from law school.

This made all the difference. Having someone who's been through the founder journey means they anticipate needs you didn't even know you had.

**The Rebrand: From Quot Health to Wyng**

We wanted to be a support to users at any point in their healthcare journey—essentially, a Healthcare Guardian Angel. The name Wyng captured this perfectly.

If someone had a question about cost, they could use Wyng. If they were unsure about their bill, they could use Wyng. If they didn't understand when and how their coinsurance works—you guessed it, they could use Wyng.

**Our Differentiation**

The other players in this space were primarily services that audited bills on behalf of users. While this is valuable, it didn't address the fundamental problem—we needed to go further upstream.

We were positioned to leverage AI to not only speed up bill auditing services but ensure it was scalable and accessible to any American who wanted to use it.

**Personal Life Changes Everything**

On a personal note, my wife and I had our first child this month! This changed everything:
- My available time was different
- I needed to be more discerning about resources (money) directed toward Wyng
- I had a different sense of urgency

Having a child doesn't just change your schedule—it changes your relationship with risk, with time, and with what matters most.
