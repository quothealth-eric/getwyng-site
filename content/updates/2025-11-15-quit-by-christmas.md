# The "Quit by Christmas" Opportunity - When Timing is Everything

**November 2025**

Found a VC firm with a "Quit by Christmas" initiative—apply, hear back in 48 hours, potentially have funding by year-end. Everything about their investment philosophy aligned with what we were building. Sometimes the universe sends you a sign.

**Missing the Deadline... Or Did I?**

I originally realized the posted deadline had passed when I found the opportunity. But like the persevering founder I am, I went to apply anyway. What's the worst that could happen—they say no?

When I found the application, they had extended the deadline. I submitted the application the night before Thanksgiving. Sometimes persistence meets opportunity at exactly the right moment.

**The LinkedIn Strategy**

While waiting, I didn't just sit idle. I found and connected with the partners on LinkedIn, naturally engaging with their recent posts and crafting that perfect message—the kind that needs to cut through hundreds of others they receive monthly.

I sent a message to one partner, letting him know he'd be seeing my application coming across his desk. I wanted to put a face to the application, make it human.

**The Email That Changed Everything**

As fate would have it, after sending the LinkedIn message, I checked my email. That very partner had already sent me an email asking to schedule time to discuss my company. My application had made it past the first step.

The timing was almost unbelievable. Here I was, trying to get his attention, and he was already reaching out to me.

**The Conversation**

The meeting was amazing. Clear interest in the problem we were solving and our approach to solving it. He wanted me to connect with founders from three different portfolio companies working in similar spaces—5 founders total.

I sent messages to all of them. ONE responded.

**The Most Valuable 45 Minutes**

That one conversation lasted 45 minutes and was one of the most productive since starting this company. This CEO had absolutely nothing to gain by sharing his knowledge and experiences with me, but he did. And I will be forever grateful.

His insights solidified my desire to continue building toward fixing this major national problem. But he also helped me see where I might need to adjust my approach.

**The Reality Check**

My ideal customer is self-funded employers. But with changes in employer-sponsored health insurance, companies are growing weary of operating in the healthcare business. More are shifting toward ICHRAs (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements).

With ICHRAs, employers still technically offer health insurance coverage, but they relinquish responsibility for ensuring the coverage is good and addressing health insurance-related issues. The responsibility shifts to the employee.

This wasn't just market intelligence—it was a potential pivot staring me in the face.
