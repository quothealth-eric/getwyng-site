# The Friends & Family Pivot - Raising from Strength

**September 2025**

After months of VC conversations, we made a strategic decision that would fundamentally change our fundraising approach: pivoting from a $1.5M institutional round to a smaller Friends & Family round.

**The Investor Feedback Pattern**

The feedback from VCs was remarkably consistent:
- "We love the problem and your approach to solving it"
- "The market opportunity is clearly massive"
- "But we need to see traction before we can commit"

This wasn't rejection—it was valuable market intelligence. Investors wanted proof points before putting institutional money to work.

**The Strategic Pivot**

Rather than spend months trying to convince investors to bet on potential, we decided to raise just enough capital to build that proof. The new approach:

- **Smaller raise**: $250K-$500K instead of $1.5M
- **Preserve equity**: Keep dilution minimal at this early stage
- **Focus on pilots**: Fund just enough to go live with employer pilots
- **Revenue-driven growth**: Use pilot revenue to fund additional development

**Friends & Family Advantages**

This pivot aligned perfectly with our situation:
- Friends and family invest in the founder, not just metrics
- Smaller checks mean faster decisions
- Personal relationships provide more patient capital
- Success with F&F proves concept for later institutional rounds

**Building Toward Revenue**

The goal became simple: raise enough to build and deploy pilots that generate revenue. Once we had paying customers and proven savings, the next fundraising conversation would be from a position of strength, not need.

This shift represented a maturation in our thinking about capital strategy—raise what you need when you need it, not what you want when it's convenient.
