# Finding (and Losing) a Co-Founder

**July 2024**

Based on conversations and my desire to move quickly, I found someone I felt comfortable working with as a co-founder. We weren't technically friends, but we'd worked together before and I thought that would be enough connection for a good working relationship. We were both excited.

**The Initial Vision**

I laid out the plan for what was still called Quot Health, Inc. Our focus was clear: build the price transparency tool that smaller health plans were required to have but couldn't afford to build themselves.

The logic seemed sound:
- Large plans (United, BCBS) already had these tools or could build them
- Smaller, regional health plans lacked the infrastructure
- We could build a white-label solution for them

I spent time researching smaller health plans in Florida and found several that didn't have the required price transparency tools yet. The market opportunity felt real and accessible.

**Compatibility Lessons**

Here's what I learned the hard way: compatibility between co-founders goes beyond just liking each other or having worked together before. You need to be aligned on:
- Working style
- Goals and timeline
- Lifestyle and availability
- Risk tolerance
- Vision for the product

At the time, I thought shared excitement was enough. I was wrong.
