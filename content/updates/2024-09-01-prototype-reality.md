# Building While the Foundation Crumbles

**September 2024**

We developed the wireframe and visual design for the application. This was a SUPER basic prototype, but it was real—something tangible that showed how the price transparency tool would actually work.

**The Equity Split**

My co-founder and I agreed on an equity split: 51% me, 49% him. Based on everything I'd read, avoiding a 50/50 split was crucial for future decision-making and reflected the groundwork already done. The split was virtually equal, but the scale was slightly tilted in my direction.

All paperwork was signed.

**What I Didn't Realize**

Signing paperwork doesn't solve fundamental misalignments. It just makes them more expensive to undo later.

We had a legal structure, we had equity splits, we had wireframes—all the external markers of a "real" company. But we still only had one official meeting at this point, and the pressure testing of our co-founder relationship was already beginning.

**The Product Vision**

Despite the interpersonal challenges, the product vision was getting clearer. We knew what we wanted to build and why it mattered. The wireframes showed a path forward that made sense.

Sometimes you have to keep building even when you're not sure who you're building with.
