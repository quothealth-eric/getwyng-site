# The Difficult Conversation

**November 2024**

We had the difficult conversation to sever our co-founder relationship. Having just recently signed all the legal paperwork, this was time and money we really didn't have to spend undoing what we'd spent months creating. But it was necessary.

**Why It Had to Happen**

The company direction needed to be maintained and clear. When co-founders have two different ideas and directions, it's impossible for the company to arrive at the same point. I learned that fundamental misalignment doesn't resolve itself—it only gets more expensive over time.

**The Logistics of Separation**

The timing was terrible. November, with holidays and cultural celebrations, made finding mutual time to meet nearly impossible. We were essentially communicating solely via email about dissolving a partnership. Not ideal, but sometimes you work with the constraints you have.

**The MVP Was Complete**

Despite everything, the MVP was done. We had built:
- Interface for user demographic information (name, DOB, address)
- Insurance details input (insurance name, policy ID)
- Insurance status verification (deductible, copay, coinsurance, cost share)
- TiC file integration for actual out-of-pocket cost calculations
- Provider-specific pricing based on negotiated rates

The product worked. The vision was validated. Now it was time to get in front of potential clients.

**Market Validation and Pushback**

We'd spoken with people who worked in insurance companies and understood the problem we were solving. Not all feedback was encouraging. I'll never forget one question: "How is this different from what Optum is offering?"

Valid question. But I was firm in my belief that Big Data and Big Insurance consolidation was a problem, not a solution. UHG/Optum already "owned" enough of healthcare. What would keep them honest about providing accurate rates for competitors? It felt like a conflict of interest.

Sure, they had the resources—according to their earnings calls, more money than God. But I believed competition was important, and smaller health plans needed their own tools.
