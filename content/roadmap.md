## The 10-Year Vision

> No American should ever be bankrupted by a bill they don't understand.

Wyng becomes the default layer between patients and the healthcare billing system. Every interaction with healthcare costs—from pre-care estimates to post-care disputes to financial protection—runs through Wyng.

**Exit potential:**
- Strategic acquisition by health insurer (cost reduction)
- Acquisition by benefits platform (feature expansion)
- Acquisition by healthcare payments company (infrastructure play)
- IPO (if we become the category leader)
