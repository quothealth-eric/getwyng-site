> The real lessons from building Wyng

## 🤝 On Co-Founder Relationships

### What I thought:
> "Working together before + mutual excitement = good co-founder fit."

### What happened:
We spent months building legally and then had to spend time and money undoing it all. We only had one official meeting in months. Clear vision misalignment emerged.

### The lesson:
**Compatibility is more than professional history.** Co-founders must align on:
- Working style and availability
- Vision for the end product
- Communication preferences
- Urgency and timeline
- Risk tolerance

**Key insight:** External structure (paperwork, equity splits) can't fix internal dysfunction. Test the relationship before you legalize it.

## 🔄 On Pivots and Political Landscape

### What I thought:
> "Price transparency regulations are stable—build on them."

### What happened:
New administration brought uncertainty. Would TiC requirements still exist? Health insurance lobbying power was real. The regulatory foundation of our B2B model was at risk.

### The lesson:
**Build on problems that can't be regulated away.** Pivoting from compliance tools (for insurers) to empowerment tools (for consumers) aligned us with permanent pain points:
- 80%+ of bills have errors
- Information imbalance creates power differentials
- People need transparency at the moment of decision

**Key insight:** When external uncertainty threatens your foundation, refocus on problems that transcend political cycles.

## 💰 On Fundraising

### What I thought:
> "Raise pre-seed, then build."

### What happened:
No traction = no leverage. Every investor loved the story but wanted to see proof.

### The lesson:
**Raise from strength, not desperation.** I pivoted from a larger pre-seed to a smaller F&F round to:
- Preserve equity at this stage
- Build proof points first (signed LOIs)
- Raise the next round from a position of strength

**Key insight:** Signed LOIs > pitch deck promises. Every time.

## 🎯 On Go-to-Market

### What I thought:
> "DTC first—consumers feel the pain directly."

### What happened:
Consumer acquisition is expensive. Conversion is slow. And individuals don't pay for prevention.

### The lesson:
**B2B solves the adoption problem.** Self-funded employers:
- Pay on behalf of employees (removes friction)
- Have budget for benefits innovation
- Want measurable ROI to justify the spend
- Provide built-in scale (1 sale = 1,000+ users)

DTC becomes the *second* motion, fueled by brand awareness from B2B.

## 🛠️ On Building

### What I thought:
> "Ship fast, fix later."

### What happened:
Healthcare is different. One error in a bill audit recommendation destroys trust forever.

### The lesson:
**Zero tolerance for shortcuts in healthcare.** Every regulatory citation must be accurate. Every audit rule must be defensible. The product must be right before it's fast.

This is why I built the 18-rule audit engine myself—I needed to know every edge case.

## 👥 On Being a Solo Founder

### What I thought:
> "I can do it all."

### What happened:
You *can* do it all. You just can't do it all *fast*. And fundraising as a solo founder is harder—investors worry about single points of failure.

### The lesson:
**Advisors aren't names on a slide.** My advisors (Mark, Chad, Kashyap) function as fractional operators. Weekly calls. Real decisions. Actual work.

The right co-founder will come—but only when I can offer a funded company with traction, not just an idea.

---

## 🎭 On Rebranding and Identity

### What I thought:
> "The product vision is what matters—names don't."

### What happened:
Quot Health felt technical and industry-focused. When we pivoted to consumers, we needed something that felt like a helper, not a vendor. "Wyng" as a Healthcare Guardian Angel resonated immediately.

### The lesson:
**Brand identity should match your user's emotional need.** People don't want another healthcare vendor—they want someone in their corner. The rebrand aligned our identity with our mission of being there whenever and wherever people need healthcare support.

## 👶 On Personal Life Changes

### What I thought:
> "I can maintain the same pace and risk tolerance after having a child."

### What happened:
Everything changed. Available time, resource consciousness, sense of urgency, and relationship with risk all shifted fundamentally.

### The lesson:
**Life changes make you a better founder, not a worse one.** Having a child forced me to:
- Be more discerning about resource allocation
- Focus on what truly matters
- Move with greater intentionality
- Think longer-term about sustainability

**Key insight:** Constraints often create focus. The limitation became a clarifying force.

---

## 🏥 On Healthcare

### What I thought:
> "The problem is obvious. The market is ready."

### What happened:
The problem *is* obvious. But healthcare moves slow. Buyers have long procurement cycles. Compliance adds friction. Trust takes time.

### The lesson:
**Timing matters more than I realized.** The market is actually favorable *now*:
- Rising marketplace premiums
- Higher deductibles
- New price transparency mandates
- No Surprises Act (2022) created rights but no tools

We're building at the right moment—but execution speed must account for market speed.

---

## 📊 On Metrics That Matter

### What I thought:
> "MAUs, DAUs, engagement..."

### What happened:
In B2B benefits, employers care about exactly three things:

1. **Does it save money?** (PMPM savings)
2. **Will employees actually use it?** (Adoption rate)
3. **Does it reduce HR burden?** (Support tickets)

### The lesson:
**Vanity metrics don't close deals.** Prove $3-6 PMPM savings with real data, and the sale writes itself.

---

## 🤔 On Pivots

### What I thought:
> "The plan is the plan."

### What happened:
Every investor conversation taught me something. Every employer meeting refined the positioning. The product vision stayed constant, but the path changed constantly.

### The lesson:
**Strong opinions, loosely held.** The mission is fixed. The tactics are flexible. Listen to the market, but don't lose the plot.

## 📝 Note to Other Founders

Building in public means sharing the failures, not just the wins. If you're reading this and considering starting something:

1. **The idea is 10%. Execution is 90%.** Everyone has ideas. Very few people build.

2. **Your unfair advantage matters.** Mine is 10+ years across patient, provider, and payer. What's yours?

3. **Traction > deck.** Stop polishing slides. Start getting customers.

4. **It's lonely.** Find your people. Advisors, fellow founders, anyone who gets it.

5. **The market doesn't care about your timeline.** It takes longer than you think. Plan for 2x the runway.
