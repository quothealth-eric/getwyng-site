> The real lessons from building Wyng

## 💰 On Fundraising

### What I thought:
> "Raise pre-seed, then build."

### What happened:
No traction = no leverage. Every investor loved the story but wanted to see proof.

### The lesson:
**Raise from strength, not desperation.** I pivoted from a larger pre-seed to a smaller F&F round to:
- Preserve equity at this stage
- Build proof points first (signed LOIs)
- Raise the next round from a position of strength

**Key insight:** Signed LOIs > pitch deck promises. Every time.

## 🎯 On Go-to-Market

### What I thought:
> "DTC first—consumers feel the pain directly."

### What happened:
Consumer acquisition is expensive. Conversion is slow. And individuals don't pay for prevention.

### The lesson:
**B2B solves the adoption problem.** Self-funded employers:
- Pay on behalf of employees (removes friction)
- Have budget for benefits innovation
- Want measurable ROI to justify the spend
- Provide built-in scale (1 sale = 1,000+ users)

DTC becomes the *second* motion, fueled by brand awareness from B2B.

## 🛠️ On Building

### What I thought:
> "Ship fast, fix later."

### What happened:
Healthcare is different. One error in a bill audit recommendation destroys trust forever.

### The lesson:
**Zero tolerance for shortcuts in healthcare.** Every regulatory citation must be accurate. Every audit rule must be defensible. The product must be right before it's fast.

This is why I built the 18-rule audit engine myself—I needed to know every edge case.

## 👥 On Being a Solo Founder

### What I thought:
> "I can do it all."

### What happened:
You *can* do it all. You just can't do it all *fast*. And fundraising as a solo founder is harder—investors worry about single points of failure.

### The lesson:
**Advisors aren't names on a slide.** My advisors (Mark, Chad, Kashyap) function as fractional operators. Weekly calls. Real decisions. Actual work.

The right co-founder will come—but only when I can offer a funded company with traction, not just an idea.

## 🏥 On Healthcare

### What I thought:
> "The problem is obvious. The market is ready."

### What happened:
The problem *is* obvious. But healthcare moves slow. Buyers have long procurement cycles. Compliance adds friction. Trust takes time.

### The lesson:
**Timing matters more than I realized.** The market is actually favorable *now*:
- Rising marketplace premiums
- Higher deductibles
- New price transparency mandates
- No Surprises Act (2022) created rights but no tools

We're building at the right moment—but execution speed must account for market speed.

## 📊 On Metrics That Matter

### What I thought:
> "MAUs, DAUs, engagement..."

### What happened:
In B2B benefits, employers care about exactly three things:

1. **Does it save money?** (PMPM savings)
2. **Will employees actually use it?** (Adoption rate)
3. **Does it reduce HR burden?** (Support tickets)

### The lesson:
**Vanity metrics don't close deals.** Prove $3-6 PMPM savings with real data, and the sale writes itself.

## 🤔 On Pivots

### What I thought:
> "The plan is the plan."

### What happened:
Every investor conversation taught me something. Every employer meeting refined the positioning. The product vision stayed constant, but the path changed constantly.

### The lesson:
**Strong opinions, loosely held.** The mission is fixed. The tactics are flexible. Listen to the market, but don't lose the plot.

## 📝 Note to Other Founders

Building in public means sharing the failures, not just the wins. If you're reading this and considering starting something:

1. **The idea is 10%. Execution is 90%.** Everyone has ideas. Very few people build.

2. **Your unfair advantage matters.** Mine is 10+ years across patient, provider, and payer. What's yours?

3. **Traction > deck.** Stop polishing slides. Start getting customers.

4. **It's lonely.** Find your people. Advisors, fellow founders, anyone who gets it.

5. **The market doesn't care about your timeline.** It takes longer than you think. Plan for 2x the runway.
